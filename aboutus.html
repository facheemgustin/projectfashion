      <center>Hi My name is Facheem Gustin and I am a rising Senior. I am planning to go to  college in the fall of 2018. I am
planning in majoring Business. At first it was hard doing coding but after a couple of weeks I started to get the hang out of everything.
While doing this project it was hard but when I had my team members that was encourging you it worked well in the end. I love eating Ice cream and 
and French Fries. I dislike chemistry since it's difficult for me to learn about balancing the equations.</center></th>

      <center>My name is Kimberly and I am a rising senior at Brooklyn Technical High School. I am turning 17 on September 4th and have always
  had a passion for photography and music. I love fried chicken and enjoy reading Young Adult novels. I am also interested in Chemical
 Engineering and Computer Science. I've had the pleasure of working with other supportive Girls Who Code students and hope you enjoy our project!</center></th>

      <center>My name is Zonel Antoine-Paul and I am currently a junior at HIgh School for Dual Language and Asian Studies in Lower Manhattan. 
 My hobbies include reading, listening to music, writing, and clothing interests. I am interested in Law and Computer Science. 
  I joined Girls Who Code to get an experience with coding, come to find that I actually love it and plan to use it in my future. 
  I tell everyone this because everytime I do, their mouths literally fall open. I am currently learning Mandarin, going on two years now.
  This project combines my interest in fashion as well as coding and I was glad to work with the people that I worked with. Thank You.</center></th>
