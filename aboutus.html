      <h1>About the creators of Tailored by you!</h1>
<p>Hi My name is Facheem Gustin and I am a rising Senior. I am planning to go to  college in the fall of 2018. I am
planning in majoring Business. At first it was hard doing coding but after a couple of weeks I started to get the hang out of everything.
While doing this project it was hard but when I had my team members that was encourging you it worked well in the end. I love eating Ice cream and 
and French Fries. I dislike chemistry since it's difficult for me to learn about balancing the equations. </p>    
  
  <p2>My name is Kimberly and I am a rising senior at Brooklyn Technical High School. I am turning 17 on September 4th and have always
  had a passion for photography and music. I love fried chicken and enjoy reading Young Adult novels. I am also interested in Chemical
 Engineering and Computer Science. I've had the pleasure of working with other supportive Girls Who Code students and hope you enjoy our project!</p2>
  
  <p3>I am Mia Harrison. I am a 15 year old upcoming junior at Edward R. Murrow High School. I am apart of the communications art 
   program where i do many different things. I participate in different programs like the Sing production, the costume department,
   the fashion club, the dance ensemble, and the step team. I also enjoy and do well in my science and math classes. I also enjoy doing
   creative things during my free time like crocheting, doing new d.i.y’s and watching movies. Also on my free time i help my mom with
    her new Jewelry business.</p3>
