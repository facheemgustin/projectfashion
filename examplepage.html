<div>Hi My name is Facheem Gustin and I am a rising Senior. I am planning to go to  college in the fall of 2018. I am
planning in majoring Business. At first it was hard doing coding but after a couple of weeks I started to get the hang out of everything.
While doing this project it was hard but when I had my team members that was encourging you it worked well in the end. I love eating Ice cream and 
and French Fries. I dislike chemistry since it's difficult for me to learn about balancing the equations.</div>
